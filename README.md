This repository contains code that was used in the analyses for the manuscript titled **Reductions of invertebrate herbivory by land use in forests and grasslands are only partly explained by changes in plant communities**.

The main part of the analyses is contained in the following two files:

-   **Community_metrics.R**: Calculation of the different metrics to characterize plant and insect communities in different ecosystems (forests, grasslands) and at aggregation levels (community level, species level)  
-   **Analysis_plotting.R**: Main analyses and plots presented in the manuscript

In the additional file **Massloss_estimation.R**, massloss to herbivory is estimated in (close-to) monoculture forest. Results are presented in the appendix of the manuscript.  

Package versions are recorded in **renv.lock**.
