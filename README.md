This repository contains code that was used in the analyses for the manuscript titled **Reduction of invertebrate herbivory by land use is only partly explained by changes in plant and insect characteristics**.

The main part of the analyses is contained in the following two files:

-   **Community_metrics.R**: Calculation of the different metrics to characterize plant and insect communities in different ecosystems (forests, grasslands) and at aggregation levels (community level, species level). Results of these analyses are available from the BEXIS repository ([https://www.bexis.uni-jena.de](https://www.bexis.uni-jena.de/)).
-   **Analysis_plotting.R**: Main analyses and plots presented in the manuscript

In the additional file **Massloss_estimation.R**, massloss to herbivory is estimated in (close-to) monoculture forest. Results are presented in the appendix of the manuscript.

Package versions are recorded in **renv.lock**.
